# TASK: Write a function that shifts each letter in a string by a given number.

# Define a function that takes a string and an integer shift value as parameters 


# Create an empty list to store the shifted characters  


# Loop through each character in the string:


# If the character is a letter (A-Z or a-z):


# Shift the letter by adding the shift value to its ASCII code (use the ord function)


# Convert the new ASCII code back to a character (use the chr function)


# Add the shifted character to the list


# If the character is not a letter:


# Add the character unchanged to the list


# After the loop, join the list into a string and return it 


# Get user input for the message and shift value  


# Call the function with the inputs and display the result
